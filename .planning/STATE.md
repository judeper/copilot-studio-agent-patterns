## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**v1.0 decisions:** See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v2.0 key decisions:**
- Fire-and-forget PCF output binding for email send
- Flow-guaranteed audit trail for all outcome tracking
- Sender-adaptive triage thresholds (80%/40%/60% boundaries)
- 30-day rolling window for sender profiles

**v2.1 approach:**
- AI Council: 3 rounds (Platform, Frontend, Integration) x 3 agents (Correctness, Implementability, Gaps)
- After each round, reconcile disagreements via targeted research
- Remediate deploy-blocking issues; document deferrals for the rest

### Pending Todos

1. **Research Copilot Outlook catchup feature for OOO agent** — Evaluate Copilot in Outlook's "Catch Up" OOO summary feature as a potential new agent pattern

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
