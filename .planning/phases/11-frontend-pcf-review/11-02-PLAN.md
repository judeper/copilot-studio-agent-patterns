<objective>
Reconcile the three independent AI Council findings into a single unified assessment of the frontend/PCF layer. Resolve disagreements between agents, deduplicate overlapping issues, assign final severity, and produce a phase verdict.

Purpose: Independent reviews create value through diverse perspectives but also create noise (duplicate findings, contradictions, severity disagreements). Reconciliation produces a single actionable output that Phase 13 (Remediation) can execute against. This also produces the definitive tech debt classification (PCF-02) that determines what must be fixed before deployment.

Output: Two documents — (1) a reconciled findings list with final dispositions, and (2) a frontend review verdict with pass/fail per PCF requirement.

  <name>Task 1: Merge, deduplicate, and reconcile findings from all three agents</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/11-frontend-pcf-review/11-02-reconciled-findings.md</files>
  <action>
Read all three findings documents from Plan 11-01. Produce a single reconciled findings document.

**Step 1: Extract and catalog all issues**

Build a master list of every issue from all three reports. For each issue, record:
- Source agent(s) (Correctness, Implementability, Gaps — or multiple if flagged by more than one)
- Artifact (file path)
- Issue description
- Severity from each agent that flagged it

**Step 2: Deduplicate**

Identify issues that are the same underlying problem flagged by multiple agents. Merge these into single entries, noting which agents flagged them and preserving the most detailed description. Issues flagged by 2+ agents are stronger signals.

Pay special attention to dedup across these common overlap areas:
- Type mismatch issues found by Correctness AND Gaps (same root cause, different angles)
- Missing error handling found by Implementability AND Gaps (runtime vs. gap perspective)
- Tech debt items may appear in all three reports — consolidate into single entries with the Gaps agent's classification as baseline

**Step 3: Resolve disagreements**

For each case where agents disagree on severity or whether something is an issue at all:
1. State the disagreement clearly (e.g., "Correctness says deploy-blocking, Gaps says non-blocking")
2. Research the specific behavior using the source files — re-read the relevant artifact and cross-reference with what each agent claimed
3. Make a final ruling with documented reasoning
4. If genuinely ambiguous, classify as deploy-blocking (err on the side of caution)

**Step 4: Finalize tech debt classifications (PCF-02)**

For EACH of the 7 known v2.0 tech debt items (#7 through #13 from PROJECT.md), produce a final classification:
- **Deploy-blocking**: Must fix before deployment — explain what breaks if not fixed
- **Deferrable**: Can deploy without fixing — explain the degraded experience and recommended timeline

This is a critical deliverable — the tech debt classification directly determines Phase 13 remediation scope.

**Step 5: Assign final categories**

Classify every reconciled issue into exactly one category:
- **BLOCK**: Deploy-blocking — must be fixed in Phase 13 before deployment
- **WARN**: Non-blocking — should be fixed but deployment can proceed
- **INFO**: Informational — documented constraint or known limitation, no fix needed
- **FALSE**: False positive — agent was wrong, issue does not actually exist (document why)

**Step 6: Map issues to PCF requirements**

Tag each issue with the PCF requirement(s) it affects:
- PCF-01: Component architecture (state, props, hooks patterns)
- PCF-02: Tech debt categorization (v2.0 items classified)
- PCF-03: Test coverage assessment (gaps identified and prioritized)
- PCF-04: Data flow correctness (Dataverse → hook → component → render)
- PCF-05: Error handling and UX gaps (no missing error states or raw errors)

Write the reconciled findings document with this structure:
```
# Reconciled Frontend/PCF Findings

## Summary
[Total unique issues: X (Y BLOCK, Z WARN, W INFO, V FALSE)]
[Agents agreed on N issues, disagreed on M issues]

## Reconciliation Methodology
[How disagreements were resolved]

## Tech Debt Classification (PCF-02)
| # | Item | Classification | Rationale |
|---|------|---------------|-----------|
| 7 | Staleness polling cleanup | [BLOCK/DEFER] | [reason] |
| 8 | BriefingView test coverage | [BLOCK/DEFER] | [reason] |
... (all 7 items)

## BLOCK — Deploy-Blocking Issues
For each:
| ID | Requirement | Artifact | Issue | Flagged By | Remediation |
[Detailed description, evidence, specific remediation steps]

## WARN — Non-Blocking Issues
[Same format]

## INFO — Known Constraints
[Same format, but with "accepted risk" rationale instead of remediation]

## FALSE — False Positives
[Issue description, which agent flagged it, why it is not actually an issue]

## Disagreement Log
| Issue | Agent A Said | Agent B Said | Resolution | Reasoning |

  <name>Task 2: Produce frontend review verdict with per-requirement pass/fail status</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/11-frontend-pcf-review/11-02-frontend-review-verdict.md</files>
  <action>
Read the reconciled findings document from Task 1. Produce the final frontend review verdict.

**Step 1: Evaluate each PCF requirement**

For each requirement, determine pass/fail based on the reconciled findings:

- **PCF-01** (Component architecture): PASS if component patterns are consistent with no structural anti-patterns that would cause runtime failures. CONDITIONAL PASS if only WARN issues exist. FAIL if any BLOCK issues affect component architecture.
- **PCF-02** (Tech debt categorization): PASS if all 7 v2.0 tech debt items have a definitive classification with documented rationale. This requirement is about CLASSIFYING, not fixing — so it passes if the classification is complete regardless of how many items are deploy-blocking.
- **PCF-03** (Test coverage assessment): PASS if test coverage gaps are identified and prioritized. CONDITIONAL PASS if gaps exist but are all categorized. FAIL if test gaps create deploy-blocking risk (e.g., critical hooks have zero coverage).
- **PCF-04** (Data flow correctness): PASS if the Dataverse → useCardData → component → render data flow is verified as correct at every transformation step. FAIL if any BLOCK issues affect data flow integrity.
- **PCF-05** (Error/UX handling): PASS if no deploy-blocking error handling or UX gaps exist. CONDITIONAL PASS if only WARN-level gaps exist. FAIL if users would encounter unhandled errors or completely broken UX states.

**Step 2: Compute phase verdict**

- **PASS**: All 5 requirements PASS
- **CONDITIONAL PASS**: All requirements PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS (WARN issues exist but no BLOCK issues)
- **FAIL**: Any requirement FAIL (BLOCK issues exist that must be remediated in Phase 13)

**Step 3: Generate remediation backlog for Phase 13**

For each BLOCK issue, create a remediation item:
- Issue ID (from reconciled findings)
- Artifact to modify (specific file path)
- Specific fix required (what code change is needed)
- Estimated complexity (trivial / moderate / complex)
- Dependencies (does fixing this require fixing something else first?)

For each WARN issue, create a deferral candidate:
- Issue ID
- Why it is non-blocking
- Recommended timeline (fix in Phase 13 if time permits, or defer to future milestone)

**Step 4: Merge with Phase 10 remediation backlog**

Reference the Phase 10 verdict's remediation backlog (9 BLOCK issues from platform review). The Phase 13 executor needs a unified picture. Note:
- How many total BLOCK issues exist across Phases 10 + 11
- Whether any Phase 11 BLOCK issues depend on Phase 10 BLOCK fixes
- Suggested execution order for Phase 13

Write the verdict document with this structure:
```
# Frontend/PCF Review — Verdict

## Overall Verdict: [PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL]

## Requirement Status

| Requirement | Status | BLOCK | WARN | INFO | Details |
|-------------|--------|-------|------|------|---------|
| PCF-01 | [PASS/COND/FAIL] | N | N | N | [one-line summary] |
| PCF-02 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PCF-03 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PCF-04 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PCF-05 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Tech Debt Summary
[Quick reference: N of 7 tech debt items classified as deploy-blocking]

## Remediation Backlog (for Phase 13)

### Deploy-Blocking Fixes Required
[Ordered by dependency, then complexity]
| # | Issue ID | Artifact | Fix Description | Complexity |

### Deferral Candidates
[WARN issues that could be deferred]
| # | Issue ID | Artifact | Issue | Recommended Action |

## Cross-Phase Impact (Phases 10 + 11)
[Total BLOCK issues across both phases, dependency analysis, suggested Phase 13 execution order]

## Key Insights
[3-5 most important findings across all requirements]

## Comparison: Agent Agreement
[How much did the three agents agree? What topics generated the most disagreement?]
