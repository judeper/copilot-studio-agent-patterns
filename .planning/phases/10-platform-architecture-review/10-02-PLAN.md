<objective>
Reconcile the three independent AI Council findings into a single unified assessment. Resolve disagreements between agents, deduplicate overlapping issues, assign final severity, and produce a phase verdict.

Purpose: Independent reviews create value through diverse perspectives but also create noise (duplicate findings, contradictions, severity disagreements). Reconciliation produces a single actionable output that Phase 13 (Remediation) can execute against.

Output: Two documents — (1) a reconciled findings list with final dispositions, and (2) a platform review verdict with pass/fail per PLAT requirement.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Merge, deduplicate, and reconcile findings from all three agents</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-platform-architecture-review/10-02-reconciled-findings.md</files>
  <action>
Read all three findings documents from Plan 10-01. Produce a single reconciled findings document.

**Step 1: Extract and catalog all issues**

Build a master list of every issue from all three reports. For each issue, record:
- Source agent(s) (Correctness, Implementability, Gaps — or multiple if flagged by more than one)
- Artifact (file path)
- Issue description
- Severity from each agent that flagged it

**Step 2: Deduplicate**

Identify issues that are the same underlying problem flagged by multiple agents. Merge these into single entries, noting which agents flagged them and preserving the most detailed description. Issues flagged by 2+ agents are stronger signals.

**Step 3: Resolve disagreements**

For each case where agents disagree on severity or whether something is an issue at all:
1. State the disagreement clearly (e.g., "Correctness says deploy-blocking, Gaps says non-blocking")
2. Research the specific platform behavior using the source files — re-read the relevant artifact and cross-reference with what each agent claimed
3. Make a final ruling with documented reasoning
4. If genuinely ambiguous, classify as deploy-blocking (err on the side of caution)

**Step 4: Assign final categories**

Classify every reconciled issue into exactly one category:
- **BLOCK**: Deploy-blocking — must be fixed in Phase 13 before deployment
- **WARN**: Non-blocking — should be fixed but deployment can proceed
- **INFO**: Informational — documented constraint or known limitation, no fix needed
- **FALSE**: False positive — agent was wrong, issue does not actually exist (document why)

**Step 5: Map issues to PLAT requirements**

Tag each issue with the PLAT requirement(s) it affects:
- PLAT-01: Dataverse table/column validity
- PLAT-02: Power Automate flow buildability
- PLAT-03: Copilot Studio config completeness
- PLAT-04: Deployment script correctness
- PLAT-05: Platform limitation identification

Write the reconciled findings document with this structure:
```
# Reconciled Platform Architecture Findings

## Summary
[Total unique issues: X (Y BLOCK, Z WARN, W INFO, V FALSE)]
[Agents agreed on N issues, disagreed on M issues]

## Reconciliation Methodology
[How disagreements were resolved]

## BLOCK — Deploy-Blocking Issues
For each:
| ID | Requirement | Artifact | Issue | Flagged By | Remediation |
[Detailed description, evidence, specific remediation steps]

## WARN — Non-Blocking Issues
[Same format]

## INFO — Known Constraints
[Same format, but with "accepted risk" rationale instead of remediation]

## FALSE — False Positives
[Issue description, which agent flagged it, why it is not actually an issue]

## Disagreement Log
| Issue | Agent A Said | Agent B Said | Resolution | Reasoning |

  </verify>
  <done>Reconciled findings document exists with deduplicated issues, resolved disagreements, final severity classifications (BLOCK/WARN/INFO/FALSE), and PLAT requirement mappings</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Produce platform review verdict with per-requirement pass/fail status</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-platform-architecture-review/10-02-platform-review-verdict.md</files>
  <action>
Read the reconciled findings document from Task 1. Produce the final platform review verdict.

**Step 1: Evaluate each PLAT requirement**

For each requirement, determine pass/fail based on the reconciled findings:

- **PLAT-01** (Dataverse validity): PASS if no BLOCK issues affect Dataverse table/column definitions. CONDITIONAL PASS if only WARN issues exist. FAIL if any BLOCK issues exist.
- **PLAT-02** (Flow buildability): PASS if no BLOCK issues affect Power Automate flow specs. Same conditional/fail logic.
- **PLAT-03** (Copilot Studio completeness): PASS if no BLOCK issues affect agent configurations. Same logic.
- **PLAT-04** (Deployment scripts): PASS if no BLOCK issues affect deployment scripts. Same logic.
- **PLAT-05** (Platform limitations): PASS if all identified platform limitations have either a remediation path or are documented as accepted constraints with rationale.

**Step 2: Compute phase verdict**

- **PASS**: All 5 requirements PASS
- **CONDITIONAL PASS**: All requirements PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS (WARN issues exist but no BLOCK issues)
- **FAIL**: Any requirement FAIL (BLOCK issues exist that must be remediated in Phase 13)

**Step 3: Generate remediation backlog for Phase 13**

For each BLOCK issue, create a remediation item:
- Issue ID (from reconciled findings)
- Artifact to modify
- Specific fix required
- Estimated complexity (trivial / moderate / complex)
- Dependencies (does fixing this require fixing something else first?)

For each WARN issue, create a deferral candidate:
- Issue ID
- Why it is non-blocking
- Recommended timeline (fix in Phase 13 if time permits, or defer to future milestone)

Write the verdict document with this structure:
```
# Platform Architecture Review — Verdict

## Overall Verdict: [PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL]

## Requirement Status

| Requirement | Status | BLOCK | WARN | INFO | Details |
|-------------|--------|-------|------|------|---------|
| PLAT-01 | [PASS/COND/FAIL] | N | N | N | [one-line summary] |
| PLAT-02 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PLAT-03 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PLAT-04 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| PLAT-05 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Remediation Backlog (for Phase 13)

### Deploy-Blocking Fixes Required
[Ordered by dependency, then complexity]
| # | Issue ID | Artifact | Fix Description | Complexity |

### Deferral Candidates
[WARN issues that could be deferred]
| # | Issue ID | Artifact | Issue | Recommended Action |

## Key Insights
[3-5 most important findings across all requirements]

## Comparison: Agent Agreement
[How much did the three agents agree? What topics generated the most disagreement?]

After both tasks complete:
1. Reconciled findings document has merged and deduplicated all issues from the three agent reports
2. Every disagreement between agents is logged with resolution reasoning
3. Every issue has exactly one final classification (BLOCK/WARN/INFO/FALSE)
4. Verdict document covers all 5 PLAT requirements with explicit pass/fail
5. Remediation backlog is ordered and ready for Phase 13 consumption
6. No PLAT requirement is left unassessed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All issues from all three agent reports are accounted for (none dropped)
- Disagreements are resolved with reasoning, not just overridden
- Final verdict uses the defined PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL criteria consistently
- Remediation backlog is specific enough for Phase 13 executors to act on without re-reading the full reports
- PLAT-05 specifically addresses platform limitations with remediation paths or documented acceptance
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-platform-architecture-review/10-02-SUMMARY.md`
